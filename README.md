# Rock Climbing App Data Generation Program

This program generates random information for testing purposes in a rock climbing app. It utilizes the Faker.js library to create mock data for customers, employees, users, merchandise, and inventory. The generated data is then either posted to an API using Axios or used to generate additional lists based on fetched API responses.

# Rock Climbing App Data Generation Program

This program generates random information for testing purposes in a rock climbing app. It utilizes the Faker.js library to create mock data for customers, employees, users, merchandise, and inventory. The generated data is then either posted to an API using Axios or used to generate additional lists based on fetched API responses.

## Features

- Generates mock data for:
  - Customers
  - Employees
  - Users
  - Merchandise information
  - Inventory items

- Utilizes Faker.js for realistic data generation.
- Posts generated data to the API using Axios.
- Fetches data from the API to generate additional lists or perform operations.

## Folder and File Descriptions

### Data Generation

- **accountType/**: Contains programs for generating account information for different types of users, including customers, employees, and users. These programs are linked to `generateAccount.js`.

- **generateAccount.js**: Main program for the `accountType` folder. Generates account information for users, customers, and employees, referring to specific JSON files like `generate_user_accounts.json`.

- **generateCategory.js**: Script used to create merchandise category names and descriptions. This is a one-time use script and refers to `generateCategory.json`.

- **generateMerchandise.js**: Script used to create merchandise information by referencing `generateMerchandise.json`.

- **generateMerchandiseInventory.js**: Script used to generate merchandise inventory information, referring to `generateMerchandiseInventory.json`.

- **generateRental.js**: Script used to generate rental information, referring to `generateRental.json`.

- **generateRentalMerchandise.js**: Script used to generate rental merchandise information. It ensures that the merchandise has a `rentable` flag set to true and that SKU and name have a prefix `RENT-` to indicate rental-only items. It refers to `rentalMerchandise.json`.

- **order.js**: Script used to generate order transactions for merchandise, rentals, and passes. It refers to `generateOrder.json`.

- **coverage/**: Contains files related to test coverage reports.

- **Jenkinsfile**: Configuration file for CI/CD pipeline, used for continuous integration and testing.

- **eslint.config.mjs**: Configuration file for ESLint to ensure code quality and consistency.

### Other

- **data/**: Directory used for storing raw or intermediate data during the data generation process.

- **database/**: Stores all JSON files generated by the program, including customer, employee, and merchandise data.

- **node_modules/**: Contains all the project's dependencies installed via npm.

- **package-lock.json**: Automatically generated file that locks the versions of dependencies installed.

- **package.json**: Contains metadata about the project and its dependencies.

- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the repository.

## Credits

- **Faker.js**: Library used for generating realistic mock data.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests.
